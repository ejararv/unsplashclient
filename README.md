## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Over the past 8 months,
work in one team with high-level specialists in various fields,
I understand that I have grown a lot
in other words, I have significantly expanded my knowledge of various technologies: Tools, security, soft skills, approach to building architecture, maintaining code quality. I realized how important it is to communicate not only with my team,
but also to look for useful people who can reasonably criticize and
share their ideas.

Thanks to a good team that knows how to get involved in the workflow,
I started with small features. Next, a UI component was developed for manipulating artifacts using JFrog,
the concept in which I presented my vision of User Experience: Structure, content, navigation and how the user interacts with elements, namely:
combining several modules into one for more efficient use of the application and minimization of transitions, etc.,
Then there was a need to quickly create a small SPA to demonstrate the capabilities of our services.
The team and I then decided to develop reusable components, specific components as microfrontends, and npm packages (in the case of npm.
I created a working prototype, which can be used later in any projects and teams of the company).

In addition, it was necessary to solve the problem with e2e tests. The well-known Selenium web driver is used in the project.
The problem was instability, difficulty in maintenance
The problem was solved by replacing the technology and approach to testing.
At the moment, I have finished integrating with Gherkin files, demonstrated to the team, implemented the daily chain testing run from the docker container without using a browser. This approach incredibly speeds up and stabilizes the testing process.

Writing Jest and RTL tests.
Daily continuous integration testing

Over the past 7 months new technologies Artifactory, Jfrog api, Docker, Bamboo, RTL, Cypress, CI, Figma, Webpack, linter,

1 code review of a component I worked on with an external front end team,
from whom I adopted and implemented the best practices in our project
and defending my point of view on some kind of critic only strengthened, expanded my knowledge about some things.
